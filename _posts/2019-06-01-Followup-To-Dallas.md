As SQL Saturday comes to a close, I want to say thank you to all the organizers, speakers, and the community that attended my session.  This marks my second SQL Saturday that I have had the privelage to speak at.  The first leaving me with a good deal of room to improve.  Just ask [Akhil](https://twitter.com/_akhilm) :).

### Power BI - From Beginnning to End 
The precon that was put on by [GuyInACube](https://twitter.com/GuyInACube) was amazing.  If you have the opportunity to attend one of thier sessions, it's well worth the investment.  If it's not possible, their group is killing it with their weekly videos on [Youtube](https://guyinacube.com/videos/).

### Introduction To GitHub
