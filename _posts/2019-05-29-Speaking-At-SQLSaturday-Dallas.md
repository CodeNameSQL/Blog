Tomorrow morning I'll jump on a plane to speak at my second SQL Saturday event this year.  This has been an amazing year for personal growth and I couldn't be more thankful to those who have helped me along the way.  If you're looking to get a better understanding of working with GitHub and will be attending SQL Saturday Dallas on June 1.  Look for me in room 117 on the 1st floor at 3:45pm.  

## Session Abstract

* Initial setup of a Repository in GitHub.
* Build Issue templates for new features, bugs, or custom tasks.
* Securing the check-in/merge process to your root branch.
