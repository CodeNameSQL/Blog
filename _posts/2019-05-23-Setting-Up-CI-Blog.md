### Give me CI or Give me Death!
Let it be known, on May 23, 2019, I have successfully set up continuous integration for my blog.  This has been a goal of mine since I started blogging and working with DevOps at the shop.  Not because it was absolutely necessary to operate, but because it was something I could dig my teeth into and nerd out on.
